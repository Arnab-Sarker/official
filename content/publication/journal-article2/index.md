abstract: The phenomena of neutrino oscillations offer a great potential for probing new-physics beyond the Standard Model. Any additional effects on neutrino oscillations can help understand the nature of the non-standard effects. The violation of fundamental symmetries may appear as a probe for new-physics in various neutrino experiments. Lorentz symmetry is one such fundamental symmetry in nature and the breakdown of spacetime is a possible motivation for a departure from the standard Lorentz symmetry picture. The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is intrinsic in nature and its effects exist even in a vacuum. Neutrinos can be an intriguing probe for exploring such violations of Lorentz symmetry. The effect of violation of Lorentz invariance can be explored through its impact on the neutrino oscillation probabilities. The effect of LIV is treated as a perturbation to the standard neutrino Hamiltonian considering the Standard Model Extension (SME) framework. In this work, we have probed the effects of LIV on the measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters considering Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) as a case study. The inclusion of LIV affects the measurements of various neutrino oscillation parameters as it modifies the standard neutrino oscillation probabilities. We looked into the capability of DUNE in constraining the LIV parameters and then explored the impact of CPT-violating LIV terms on the mass-induced neutrino oscillation probabilities. We have also probed the impact of LIV parameters on the CP-measurement sensitivities at DUNE.
